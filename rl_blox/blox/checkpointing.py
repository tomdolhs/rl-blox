    Parameters
    ----------
    checkpoint_state : CheckpointState
        State of checkpoint monitoring.

    steps_per_episode : int
        Number of steps in the previous episode that just finished.

    episode_return : float
        Return of the previous episode that just finished.

    epoch : int
        Training epoch counter.

    reset_weight : float
        When ``steps_before_checkpointing`` training epochs were reached, the
        best minimum return found so far will be multiplied by this factor, so
        that from now on, actors will be evaluated more thoroughly and updated
        only after ``max_episodes_when_checkpointing`` did not fall below the
        best minimum return found so far.

    max_episodes_when_checkpointing : int
        Configuration: maximum number of assessment episodes. In the beginning,
        this value is not used, but an initial value of 1 is used in
        ``checkpoint_state``. After ``steps_before_checkpointing``, the number
        of assessment episodes will be set to this value.

    steps_before_checkpointing : int
        Configuration: number of training epochs before checkpointing with
        ``max_episodes_when_checkpointing`` episodes starts.

    Returns
    -------
    update_checkpoint : False
        Checkpoint should be updated now.

    training_steps : int
        Number of training epochs.

    Notes
    -----

    A checkpoint is a snapshot of the parameters of a model, captured at a
    specific time during training. Using the checkpoint of a policy that
    obtained a high return during training improves the stability of test time
    performance. The standard learning paradigm for off-policy RL algorithms is
    to train after each time step, which means that the policy changes
    throughout each episode, making it hard to evaluate the performance.
    Similar to many on-policy algorithms, TD7 [1]_ keeps the policy fixed for
    several assessment episodes and then batches the training that would have
    occurred. We use these assessment episodes to judge if the current policy
    outperforms the previous best policy in a similar manner to evolutionary
    approaches and save a checkpoint. The checkpoint policy is used at
    evaluation time.

    The ideal performance measure of a policy is the average return in as many
    episodes as possible. However, it is necessary to reduce the number of
    evaluation episodes to improve sample efficiency. We use the minimum
    performance to assess unstable policies with a low number of episodes as
    poorly performing policies do not waste additional assessment episodes and
    training can resume when the performance in any episode falls below the
    checkpoint performance. This idea is first used in TD7 [1]_.

    The method implemented with this function distinguishes two phases of
    checkpointing. In the beginning, we only use one assessement episode per
    actor. After ``steps_before_checkpointing`` training epochs of the actor,
    we will switch to more thorough evaluation with a maximum of
    ``max_episodes_when_checkpointing`` episodes. Before we do so, we reduce
    the best minimum fitness of the previous checkpoint by multiplying it with
    ``reset_weight``, which should be between 0 and 1.
