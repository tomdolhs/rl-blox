class ContinuousClippedDoubleQNet(nnx.Module):
    """Clipped Double Q network for continuous action spaces.

    Thin wrapper around two action-value networks. To avoid overestimation
    bias, we take the minimum of the prediction of the two networks.
    This is called clipped double Q-learning [1]_, which is based on double
    Q-learning [2]_. Note that clipped double Q-learning is not the same as
    deep double Q-learning [3]_, which is also based on the idea of double
    Q-learning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q1 : nnx.Module
        Action-value network that maps a pair of state and action to the
        estimated expected return.

    q2 : nnx.Module
        Action-value network that maps a pair of state and action to the
        estimated expected return.
